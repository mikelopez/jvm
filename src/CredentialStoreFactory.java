/**
 * Factory class providing instances of a
 * {linkplain CredentialStore credential store}.
 *
 * <p> If the file backing a credential store does not already exist, it is
 * created on the first call to {@link CredentialStore#addPassword}.
 * If the default file is being used, its directory will also be
 * created if necessary.
 *
 * <p> Each method of the returned credential store acquires a
 * {@link
 * <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/nio/channels/FileLock.html">
 * lock</a>}
 * on the store for the duration of the method call, blocking if necessary
 * to do so.  The implementation may time out (throwing {@code IOException})
 * if the lock cannot be acquired within a reasonable amount of time, on the
 * order of a minute.
 * Locks are acquired on behalf of the entire Java virtual
 * machine, not just the current thread.
 *
 * <p> The methods in this class may be invoked concurrently by multiple
 * threads.
